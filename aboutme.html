            <h1>Something about me</h1>
            <br>
            <p>From an early age I was very interested in computer programs and logic but I never had a chance to work in this field before. I have been working as a customer advisor but last year, in the middle of the pandemic, which caused the company I worked for to make me redundant, I realised that it was high time to change my career.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although I have studied Information Systems in the past and even participated in small digital projects, I never had the confidence to pursue a career in IT.  However, recently, I decided to dedicate some time to study and to brush up on the programming knowlegde because I really enjoy the idea of creating apps to solve issues in the real world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to be part of a immersive bootcamp in Software Development. I wanted to get some comercial experience of which the employers are looking in candidates and Code Nation are engaged in creating employable talent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe that with this kick start, I'll succeed as a digital professional.</p>
